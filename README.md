This repo contains my notes and code on the awesome course [Deployment of Machine Learning Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models) by Soledad Galli & Christopher Samiullah @ Udemy.

<br>

## Course objectives
---
After this course you should

1. Be able to take machine learning models from research stage to a fully integrated API.
2. Be familiar with various coding best practices.
3. Feel comfortable to deploy any machine learning model in various infrastructures.

- No machine learning model brings true value until it is fully integrated and can be used to score real data. So model deployment is the most important and yet most difficult part of any typical machine learning pipeline. <br><br>
- Model deployment requires coordination between data scientists, I.T. teams and their ops software developers, and business professionals to make sure the model works reliably in their organization's production environment. <br><br>
- This represents a major challenge. For example, there is often a discrepancy between the programming language in which the machine learning model is written and the languages your production system can understand and recoding the model can extend the project timeline by weeks or months. In order to get the most value out of the machine, it is important to deploy them into production as seamlessly as possible so the business can start using them to make practical decisions. <br><br>

## Topics covered
---
<br>

- Entire ML life cycle
- Research phase
- Transform research code into production code + best practices
- Create an API and make API calls
- Testing to make sure production models corroborate research models given same data
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Various deployment solutions, e.g. PaaS, IaaS
- Docker for reproducibility and robustness
