- No machine learning model brings true value until it is fully integrated and can be used to score real data. So model deployment is the most important and yet most difficult part of any typical machine learning pipeline. Modern deployment presents the challenges of traditional software like reliability, reusability, maintainability and flexibility, and it also presents additional challenges that are specific to machine learning, like **reproducibility**.
  
- Model deployment requires coordination between data scientists, I.T. teams and their ops software developers, and business professionals to make sure the model works reliably in their organization's production environment.

- There is often a discrepancy between the programming language in which the machine learning model is written and the languages your production system can understand and recoding the model can extend the project timeline by weeks or months and also risks lack of reproducibility. 
  
- To maximize the value of the machine learning model we create, we need to be able to reliably extract the predictions from the model and share them with other systems. The course will discuss the best practices and available solutions to mitigate the challenges that deployment of machine learning models present and streamline the integration of our machine learning models into production.

**Remark.** A more complete description is that we deploy **pipelines** not just models. This includes data preprocessing pipeline, feature engineering and selection pipeline, as well as prediction serving pipeline, monitoring and evaluation pipeline, and so on. Thus, our goal is to build **reproducible machine learning pipelines.** Tests for ML systems should always include reproducibility along with tests of performance and functionality.
