We will evaluate model performance using the mean squared error (mse) and the root squared of the mean squared error (rmse).\n","\n","### How do I download the dataset?\n","\n","To download the House Price dataset go this website:\n","https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data\n","\n","Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on the link 'train.csv', and then click the 'download' blue button towards the right of the screen, to download the dataset.

This reduces the chances of introducing bugs.\n","\n","- For model performance: Fewer variables mean simpler, more interpretable, better generalizing models\n","\n","\n","**We will select variables using the Lasso regression: Lasso has the property of setting the coefficient of non-informative variables to zero. This way we can identify those variables and remove them from our final model.**\n","\n","\n","### Setting the seed\n","\n","It is important to note, that we are engineering variables and pre-processing data with the idea of deploying the model. Therefore, from now on, for each step that includes some element of randomness, it is extremely important that we **set the seed**. This way, we can obtain reproducibility between our research and our development code.\n","\n","This is perhaps one of the most important lessons that you need to take away from this course: **Always
